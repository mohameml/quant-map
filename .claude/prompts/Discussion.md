- for the graph it can be moveable when the use click and mouve his mouse he can move the graph

- he can't click outside a node (cursoe outsoude the node look like the cursor of move (grab )) and when hover in the node the curson change to the cursoe of click (pointer)

- and yes for the color
  of a node when is start
  you say yellow : does look
  nice in this case i don't konw what you thin

- yes in the side panl after Progress there is : **Review {name-of-topic}**

- and for the archi of files what is ? and for state also how we desing it do we need zustand ???
