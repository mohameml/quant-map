## Exercise

A fair six-sided die is rolled twice in succession. Calculate the probability that the value obtained on the first roll is strictly less than the value obtained on the second roll.

## Hints

<Hint number={1}>
	The sample space consists of all ordered pairs $(x_1, x_2)$ where each value
	ranges from 1 to 6. How many such pairs are there?
</Hint>

<Hint number={2}>
For a fixed value of $x_2$, count how many values of $x_1$ satisfy $x_1 < x_2$, then sum over all possible $x_2$.
</Hint>

<Hint number={3}>
By symmetry, $P(X_1 < X_2) = P(X_1 > X_2)$. Since the three events $X_1 < X_2$, $X_1 = X_2$, and $X_1 > X_2$ partition the sample space, you can use this as a shortcut or a sanity check.
</Hint>

## Solution

Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ denote the results of the two rolls. The sample space is

$$
\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}^2,
$$

of size $36$, with all pairs equally likely.

We are looking for

$$
P\bigl(X_1 < X_2\bigr)
= \frac{\text{number of pairs }(x_1,x_2)\text{ such that }x_1 < x_2}{36}.
$$

For each value of $x_2$, the number of values of $x_1$ that are strictly smaller is $x_2 - 1$. Thus

$$
\#\{x_1 < x_2\}
= \sum_{x_2=1}^{6}(x_2 - 1)
= 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
= 15.
$$

Therefore

$$
P(X_1 < X_2)
= \frac{15}{36}
= \boxed{\frac{5}{12}}.
$$
