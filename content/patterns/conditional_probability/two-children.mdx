## Exercise

A woman has two children. Given that one of them is a girl, calculate the probability that the other is a boy.

## Hints

<Hint number={1}>
	List all equally likely outcomes for the genders of two children, then
	eliminate those incompatible with the given information.
</Hint>

<Hint number={2}>
	Think carefully about the difference between "at least one girl" and "a
	specific child is a girl" — the sample space is not the same.
</Hint>

## Solution

Let

$$
A : \{\text{the other child is a boy}\}, \qquad
B : \{\text{there is at least one girl}\}.
$$

We are looking for

$$
P(A \mid B).
$$

By Bayes' theorem,

$$
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}.
$$

The possible pairs for the two children are

$$
\Omega = \{GG,\; GF,\; FG,\; FF\},
$$

all equally likely, each with probability $\tfrac14$.

- $B = \{GF, FG, FF\}$, so $P(B) = \tfrac34$.
- $A \cap B$ corresponds to having at least one girl and the other being a boy, that is $\{GF, FG\}$, so $P(A \cap B) = \tfrac12$.

Thus,

$$
P(A \mid B)
= \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
= \frac{\tfrac12}{\tfrac34}
= \boxed{\tfrac{2}{3}}.
$$
