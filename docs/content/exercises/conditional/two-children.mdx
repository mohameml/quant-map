## Problem

A woman has two children. Given that at least one of them is a girl,
calculate the probability that the other is a boy.

## Hints

<Hint n={1}>
	List all equally likely outcomes for the genders of two children, then
	eliminate those incompatible with the given information.
</Hint>

<Hint n={2}>
	Think carefully about the difference between "at least one girl" and "a
	specific child is a girl" — the sample space is not the same.
</Hint>

## Solution

Let

$$
A : \{\text{the other child is a boy}\}, \qquad
B : \{\text{there is at least one girl}\}.
$$

We are looking for $P(A \mid B)$. By the definition of conditional probability,

$$
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}.
$$

The possible pairs for the two children are

$$
\Omega = \{GG,\; GB,\; BG,\; BB\},
$$

all equally likely, each with probability $\tfrac{1}{4}$.

- $B = \{GG, GB, BG\}$, so $P(B) = \tfrac{3}{4}$.
- $A \cap B$ corresponds to having at least one girl and the other being a boy,
  that is $\{GB, BG\}$, so $P(A \cap B) = \tfrac{1}{2}$.

Thus,

$$
P(A \mid B)
= \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
= \frac{\tfrac{1}{2}}{\tfrac{3}{4}}
= \boxed{\dfrac{2}{3}}.
$$
