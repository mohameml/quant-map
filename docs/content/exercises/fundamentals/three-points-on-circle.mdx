## Exercise

Three points $P_1, P_2, P_3$ are chosen independently and uniformly on a circle with center $O$. What is the probability that $O$ belongs to the triangle $P_1P_2P_3$?

## Hint

The center $O$ lies inside the triangle if and only if the three points are not all contained in the same semicircle. Use the complement.

## Hint

Fix one point (say $P_1$) and consider the probability that the other two points lie in a specific semicircle starting from $P_1$. Then use symmetry across all three points.

## Solution

An equivalent criterion is that $O \in \triangle P_1P_2P_3$ if and only if the three points are not contained in the same semicircle. Thus:

$$
\mathbb{P}(O \in \triangle P_1P_2P_3) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(\text{the three points are in the same semicircle})
$$

Fix $P_1$. Consider the open semicircle of arc length $\pi$ starting from $P_1$ in a given direction.

The probability that both $P_2$ and $P_3$ fall in this semicircle is:

$$
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}
$$

Define $E_i =$ "the three points are contained in a semicircle with endpoint $P_i$".

Then $\mathbb{P}(E_i) = 1/4$.

Moreover, the events $E_1, E_2, E_3$ are **disjoint**: indeed, if two of them occurred simultaneously, we would have two disjoint semicircles containing all three points, which is impossible.

Therefore:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\text{the three points are in the same semicircle}) = \mathbb{P}(E_1 \cup E_2 \cup E_3) = \sum_{i=1}^3 \mathbb{P}(E_i) = 3 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
$$

Finally:

$$
\boxed{\mathbb{P}(O \in \triangle P_1P_2P_3) = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4}}
$$
