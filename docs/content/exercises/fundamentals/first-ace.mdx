## Exercise

On average, how many cards must be turned over in a standard 52-card deck to observe the first Ace?

## Hint

Consider dividing the deck into intervals separated by the four Aces. By symmetry, how are the cards distributed among these intervals?

## Hint

Use indicator variables to count the expected number of non-Ace cards in each interval, then relate the position of the first Ace to the number of cards before it.

## Solution

Let us introduce the following variables:

$$
X_1 = \#\{\text{cards before the 1st Ace}\}, \quad X_2 = \#\{\text{cards between the 1st and 2nd Ace}\}
$$

$$
X_3 = \#\{\text{cards between the 2nd and 3rd Ace}\}, \quad X_4 = \#\{\text{cards between the 3rd and 4th Ace}\}, \quad X_5 = \#\{\text{cards after the 4th Ace}\}
$$

These five variables count the number of cards between successive Aces (or before the first and after the last).

We have:

$$
X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5 = 52 - 4 = 48
$$

since only the _non-Ace_ cards are counted in the intervals.

**Symmetry of the shuffle.**

The shuffle is perfectly uniform. The four Aces divide the 48 other cards into 5 "blocks" separated by the Aces.

By symmetry, the intervals $(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5)$ have the same expectation:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X_1] = \mathbb{E}[X_2] = \mathbb{E}[X_3] = \mathbb{E}[X_4] = \mathbb{E}[X_5]
$$

**Expectation of each $X_i$.**

Define the indicator variables:

$$
I_{j,i} = \mathbf{1}_{\{\text{the } j\text{-th non-Ace card is in interval } i\}}
$$

Then:

$$
X_i = \sum_{j=1}^{48} I_{j,i}
$$

Now:

$$
\mathbb{E}[I_{j,i}] = P(C_j \in X_i) = \frac{1}{5}
$$

Therefore:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \sum_{j=1}^{48} \mathbb{E}[I_{j,i}] = 48 \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{48}{5}
$$

Thus:

$$
\boxed{\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \frac{48}{5}} \quad \forall i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}
$$

**Position of the first Ace.**

The position $N$ of the first Ace is:

$$
N = X_1 + 1
$$

(since there are $X_1$ non-Ace cards before it, then the first Ace).

Thus:

$$
\mathbb{E}[N] = \mathbb{E}[X_1] + 1 = \frac{48}{5} + 1 = \frac{48 + 5}{5} = \boxed{\frac{53}{5}}
$$

Numerically:

$$
\mathbb{E}[N] \approx 10.6
$$
