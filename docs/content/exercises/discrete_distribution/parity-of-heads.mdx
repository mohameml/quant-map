## Exercise

Four fair and independent coins are flipped. What is the probability that the number of heads obtained is _even_?

## Hint

The number of heads follows a binomial distribution. Count the number of outcomes with 0, 2, or 4 heads using binomial coefficients.

## Solution

Let $X$ denote the number of heads. Then $X \sim \mathrm{Bin}(4, \tfrac{1}{2})$.

We want to find $\mathbb{P}(X \in \{0, 2, 4\})$:

$$
\mathbb{P}(X \in \{0, 2, 4\}) = \frac{\binom{4}{0} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{4}{4}}{2^4} = \frac{1 + 6 + 1}{16} = \frac{8}{16} = \boxed{\tfrac{1}{2}}
$$

**General case (parity for any even $n$).** For $n$ flips (with $n$ even):

$$
\sum_{k \text{ even}} \binom{n}{k} = \sum_{k \text{ odd}} \binom{n}{k} = 2^{n-1}
$$

Therefore:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\text{number of heads is even}) = \frac{2^{n-1}}{2^n} = \tfrac{1}{2}
$$
