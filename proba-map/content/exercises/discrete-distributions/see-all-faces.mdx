## Problem

A fair six-sided die is rolled over and over until every face has appeared at least once.

On average, how many rolls are needed to see all 6 faces?

## Hints

<Hint n={1}>
    This is a direct application of the Coupon Collector Problem with $N = 6$.
    Break the process into 6 phases, where phase $i$ is the time to see the
    $i$-th new face given $i-1$ already seen.
</Hint>

## Solution

This is a direct application of the **Coupon Collector Problem** with $N = 6$.

**Decomposition into phases:**

Let $T_i$ be the number of rolls needed to get the $i$-th new face, given you have already seen $i-1$ distinct faces.

At each roll, the probability of seeing a new face is:

$$
p_i = \frac{6 - (i-1)}{6} = \frac{7 - i}{6}
$$

Each roll being independent, $T_i$ counts the number of trials until the first success:

$$
T_i \sim \mathrm{Geom}(p_i) \qquad \text{with} \quad \mathbb{E}[T_i] = \frac{1}{p_i} = \frac{6}{7-i}
$$

**Detail of each phase:**

| Phase $i$ | Faces seen | $p_i$         | $\mathbb{E}[T_i]$ |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 1         | 0          | $1$           | $1$               |
| 2         | 1          | $\frac{5}{6}$ | $\frac{6}{5}$     |
| 3         | 2          | $\frac{4}{6}$ | $\frac{6}{4}$     |
| 4         | 3          | $\frac{3}{6}$ | $\frac{6}{3}$     |
| 5         | 4          | $\frac{2}{6}$ | $\frac{6}{2}$     |
| 6         | 5          | $\frac{1}{6}$ | $\frac{6}{1}$     |

**Total number of rolls:**

The total is $T = T_1 + T_2 + \cdots + T_6$. Since the $T_i$ are independent, by linearity of expectation:

$$
\mathbb{E}[T] = \sum_{i=1}^{6} \mathbb{E}[T_i] = \sum_{i=1}^{6} \frac{6}{7-i} = 6\sum_{k=1}^{6} \frac{1}{k} = 6\left(1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6}\right)
$$

$$
\mathbb{E}[T] = 6 \times \frac{49}{20} = \frac{294}{20} = \frac{147}{10}
$$

$$
\boxed{\mathbb{E}[T] = 14.7 \text{ rolls}}
$$
