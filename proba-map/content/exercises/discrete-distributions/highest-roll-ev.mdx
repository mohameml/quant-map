## Problem

Jim will roll a fair, six-sided die until he gets a 4.

**Question:** What is the expected value of the highest number he rolls through this process?

## Hints

<Hint n={1}>
Since the process stops at the first 4, the maximum $M$ must satisfy $M \in \{4, 5, 6\}$. Think about when $M = 4$: this means no 5 or 6 appeared before the first 4.
</Hint>

<Hint n={2}>
For each possible value of $M$, compute the probability by asking: "what is the probability that the first element of a certain set to appear is 4?" This is a race between competing geometric random variables.
</Hint>

## Solution

Let $T = \inf\{n \ge 1:\ X_n = 4\}$ be the time of the first 4, and

$$
M = \max\{X_1, \dots, X_T\}
$$

the highest value observed up to (and including) the first 4.

Since the process stops as soon as 4 appears, we necessarily have

$$
M \in \{4, 5, 6\}.
$$

We compute $\mathbb{P}(M = 4)$, $\mathbb{P}(M = 5)$, and $\mathbb{P}(M = 6)$.

**1. Computing $\mathbb{P}(M = 4)$.**

The event $\{M = 4\}$ means: no 5 or 6 appears before the first 4. In other words, the first element of $\{4, 5, 6\}$ observed is 4. Thus,

$$
\mathbb{P}(M = 4) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(X_1 = 4)}{\mathbb{P}(X_1 = 4) + \mathbb{P}(X_1 \in \{5, 6\})}
= \frac{\frac{1}{6}}{\frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{6}}
= \frac{1}{3}.
$$

**2. Computing $\mathbb{P}(M \le 5)$ and $\mathbb{P}(M = 6)$.**

$\{M \le 5\}$ holds if and only if no 6 appears before the first 4, i.e., the first element of $\{4, 6\}$ observed is 4:

$$
\mathbb{P}(M \le 5) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(X_1 = 4)}{\mathbb{P}(X_1 = 4) + \mathbb{P}(X_1 = 6)}
= \frac{\frac{1}{6}}{\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6}}
= \frac{1}{2}.
$$

By complementarity,

$$
\mathbb{P}(M = 6) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(M \le 5) = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

**3. Computing $\mathbb{P}(M = 5)$.**

$$
\mathbb{P}(M = 5) = \mathbb{P}(M \le 5) - \mathbb{P}(M = 4)
= \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3}
= \frac{1}{6}.
$$

**4. Expected value of $M$.**

$$
\mathbb{E}[M]
= 4\,\mathbb{P}(M = 4) + 5\,\mathbb{P}(M = 5) + 6\,\mathbb{P}(M = 6)
= 4 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 5 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 6 \cdot \frac{1}{2}
= \frac{31}{6}.
$$

$$
\boxed{\mathbb{E}[M] = \frac{31}{6}.}
$$
