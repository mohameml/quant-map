## Problem

Two players take turns rolling two six-sided dice. Player A goes first, followed by Player B. If Player A rolls a sum of 6, they win. If Player B rolls a sum of 7, they win. If neither rolls their desired value, the game continues until someone wins.

**Question:** What is the probability that Player A wins?

## Hints

<Hint n={1}>
    Compute $p_A = \mathbb{P}(\text{sum} = 6)$ and $p_B = \mathbb{P}(\text{sum}{" "}
    = 7)$ for two dice. There are 36 equally likely outcomes.
</Hint>

<Hint n={2}>
    Each round, there are three cases: A wins (probability $p_A$), A misses and
    B wins (probability $(1-p_A) p_B$), or neither wins (probability
    $(1-p_A)(1-p_B)$). Sum the geometric series for A winning at round $n$.
</Hint>

## Solution

At each round, there are three mutually exclusive cases:

- **Case 1:** Player $A$ wins with probability $p_A = \frac{5}{36}$.
- **Case 2:** Player $B$ wins (if $A$ does not win) with probability $(1-p_A)\,p_B$ where $p_B = \frac{6}{36}$.
- **Case 3:** Neither $A$ nor $B$ wins, with probability $(1-p_A)(1-p_B)$.

The total probability is

$$
p_A + (1-p_A)p_B + (1-p_A)(1-p_B) = 1.
$$

Hence, the experiment restarts independently at each new round with the same probabilities.

The probability that $A$ wins at round $n$:

- In the first $n-1$ rounds, there is no winner, which has probability $\bigl((1-p_A)(1-p_B)\bigr)^{n-1}$.
- At round $n$, $A$ wins with probability $p_A$.

Therefore,

$$
\mathbb{P}(A\text{ wins at round }n) = \bigl((1-p_A)(1-p_B)\bigr)^{n-1} p_A.
$$

Since the events are disjoint for different $n$:

$$
\mathbb{P}(A\text{ wins}) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \bigl((1-p_A)(1-p_B)\bigr)^{n-1} p_A = \frac{p_A}{1-(1-p_A)(1-p_B)}.
$$

With $p_A = \frac{5}{36}$ and $p_B = \frac{6}{36}$,

$$
(1-p_A)(1-p_B) = \frac{31}{36} \cdot \frac{30}{36} = \frac{155}{216},
$$

so

$$
\mathbb{P}(A\text{ wins}) = \frac{\frac{5}{36}}{1 - \frac{155}{216}} = \frac{\frac{5}{36}}{\frac{61}{216}} = \frac{30}{61} \approx 0.492.
$$

$$
\boxed{\mathbb{P}(A\text{ wins}) = \frac{30}{61} \approx 0.492}
$$
