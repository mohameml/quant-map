## Problem

We have a set of $100$ coins: only one is biased and has two "heads" faces,
the other $99$ are fair coins.

A coin is chosen at random and flipped $10$ times.
It lands on "heads" every time.

Calculate the probability that the chosen coin is the biased one.

## Hints

<Hint n={1}>
  Define events for choosing the biased coin vs. a fair coin, and an event for
  getting 10 heads. What are the prior probabilities of each?
</Hint>

<Hint n={2}>
  Apply Bayes' Theorem. Think carefully about the likelihood of getting 10
  heads in a row with a fair coin versus the biased coin.
</Hint>

## Solution

Let

$$
U : \{\text{the chosen coin is the biased coin}\}, \quad
F : \{\text{the chosen coin is a fair coin}\},
$$

$$
H : \{\text{all 10 flips land heads}\}.
$$

The prior probabilities are

$$
P(U) = \frac{1}{100}, \qquad
P(F) = \frac{99}{100}.
$$

By Bayes' formula,

$$
P(U \mid H)
= \frac{P(H \mid U)\,P(U)}
       {P(H \mid U)\,P(U) + P(H \mid F)\,P(F)}.
$$

Now:

$$
P(H \mid U) = 1,
\qquad
P(H \mid F) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{10}.
$$

Substituting the values,

$$
P(U \mid H)
= \frac{1 \times \tfrac{1}{100}}
       {1 \times \tfrac{1}{100} + \left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^{10} \times \tfrac{99}{100}}
= \frac{1}{1 + 99\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^{10}}.
$$

Since $\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^{10} = \tfrac{1}{1024}$, we obtain

$$
P(U \mid H)
= \frac{1}{1 + \dfrac{99}{1024}}
= \frac{1024}{1024 + 99}
= \boxed{\dfrac{1024}{1123}}.
$$
