## Problem

A baby is learning to walk with the assistance of its living room couch. The baby starts at the couch and at each time step makes a decision:

- take a step forward with probability $0.2$,
- stay in place with probability $0.5$,
- take a step back (towards the couch) with probability $0.3$.

The baby can never go behind the couch. Therefore, when the baby is at the couch, it moves forward with probability $0.2$ and stays at the couch with probability $0.8$.

If you observe the baby for an extremely long time, what proportion of the time is the baby at the couch?

## Hints

<Hint n={1}>
Model the baby's distance from the couch as a Markov chain on the state space $S = \{0, 1, 2, \dots\}$. Write the transition matrix noting the special boundary condition at state $0$.
</Hint>

<Hint n={2}>
The long-run proportion of time spent at the couch is the stationary probability $\pi_0$. Write the balance equations $\pi = \pi P$ and look for a geometric solution of the form $\pi_i = C r^i$.
</Hint>

<Hint n={3}>
You should find a characteristic equation $0.3r^2 - 0.5r + 0.2 = 0$ with roots $r = 1$ and $r = 2/3$. Only $r = 2/3$ gives a summable distribution. Use the normalization $\sum \pi_i = 1$ to find $\pi_0$.
</Hint>

## Solution

**Markov chain reminder:**

Let $(X_n)_{n\ge 0}$ be a Markov chain on a countable state space $S$ with transition matrix $P = (p_{ij})_{i,j\in S}$ where

$$
p_{ij} = \mathbb{P}(X_{n+1} = j \mid X_n = i).
$$

A probability vector $\pi = (\pi_i)_{i\in S}$ is called a stationary (equilibrium) distribution if

$$
\pi = \pi P
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\sum_{i\in S}\pi_i = 1,\;\pi_i \ge 0.
$$

When the chain is irreducible and positive recurrent, the stationary distribution is unique and $\pi_i$ represents the proportion of time spent in state $i$ as time goes to infinity.

**a. Modeling: state space and Markov property**

Let $X_n$ denote the distance (in number of steps) between the baby and the couch at time $n$. The state space is

$$
S = \{0, 1, 2, \dots\},
$$

where $0$ means "at the couch."

**b. Transition matrix $P$**

For $i \ge 1$:

$$
p_{i,i+1} = 0.2, \qquad p_{i,i} = 0.5, \qquad p_{i,i-1} = 0.3,
$$

and all other $p_{i,j} = 0$.

At the boundary $i = 0$ (couch):

$$
p_{0,1} = 0.2, \qquad p_{0,0} = 0.8,
$$

and $p_{0,j} = 0$ otherwise.

**c. Equilibrium distribution**

The long-run proportion of time spent in each state is given by the stationary distribution $\pi = (\pi_i)_{i\ge 0}$. The quantity we seek is $\pi_0$.

**d. Balance equations**

**Equation at $i = 0$:**
The only transitions leading to $0$ are: $0 \to 0$ and $1 \to 0$. Thus

$$
\pi_0 = \pi_0 \cdot 0.8 + \pi_1 \cdot 0.3,
$$

which gives

$$
0.2\,\pi_0 = 0.3\,\pi_1
\qquad\Longrightarrow\qquad
\pi_1 = \frac{2}{3}\pi_0.
$$

**Equation at $i \ge 1$:**
One can arrive at $i$ from $i-1$ (step forward), from $i$ (stay), or from $i+1$ (step back):

$$
\pi_i = 0.2\,\pi_{i-1} + 0.5\,\pi_i + 0.3\,\pi_{i+1}.
$$

Rearranging:

$$
0.3\,\pi_{i+1} = 0.5\,\pi_i - 0.2\,\pi_{i-1}.
$$

**e. General form of $\pi_i$**

We look for a solution of the form $\pi_i = C r^i$. Substituting into the recurrence for $i \ge 1$:

$$
r = 0.2 + 0.5 r + 0.3 r^2,
$$

i.e.

$$
0.3r^2 - 0.5r + 0.2 = 0.
$$

The discriminant is $\Delta = 0.25 - 0.24 = 0.01$, so

$$
r = \frac{0.5 \pm 0.1}{0.6} \in \left\{1,\;\frac{2}{3}\right\}.
$$

The root $r = 1$ would give a constant sequence that is not summable on $\{0,1,2,\dots\}$, so it is impossible for a probability distribution. We retain

$$
\pi_i = \pi_0 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^i, \qquad i \ge 0.
$$

**f. Normalization**

Using $\sum_{i=0}^\infty \pi_i = 1$:

$$
1 = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \pi_0 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^i
= \pi_0 \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \frac{2}{3}}
= \pi_0 \cdot 3,
$$

thus

$$
\pi_0 = \frac{1}{3}.
$$

**Conclusion**

The proportion of time (over a very long horizon) during which the baby is at the couch is

$$
\boxed{\pi_0 = \frac{1}{3}}.
$$
