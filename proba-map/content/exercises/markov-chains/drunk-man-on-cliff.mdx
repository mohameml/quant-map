## Problem

A drunk man stands 1 step away from the edge of a cliff. At each time step, he takes a step:

- towards the cliff (one step forward) with probability $1/2$;
- away from the cliff (one step backward) with probability $1/2$.

His distance from the edge is modeled by a process $(X_n)_{n\ge 0}$ taking values in $\{0, 1, 2, \dots\}$, with $X_0 = 1$ and $0$ representing falling off.

**Question 1:** What is the probability that he falls off the cliff?

**Question 2:** On average, how many steps does he take before falling (given that he falls)?

## Hints

<Hint n={1}>
Let $p = \mathbb{P}(\tau < \infty \mid X_0 = 1)$ where $\tau$ is the first time the man reaches $0$. Use the first-step analysis: with probability $1/2$ he falls immediately, with probability $1/2$ he goes to position 2.
</Hint>

<Hint n={2}>
To fall from position 2, the man must first reach 1 (probability $p$ by translation invariance), then fall from 1 (probability $p$ again). This gives $\mathbb{P}(\tau < \infty \mid X_0 = 2) = p^2$. Solve the resulting quadratic equation.
</Hint>

<Hint n={3}>
    For the expected time, let $m = E[\tau \mid X_0 = 1]$ and use the same
    decomposition. You should find $m = 1 + m$, which is a contradiction —
    meaning the expectation is infinite.
</Hint>

## Solution

**Setup**

Let

$$
X_n = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n}\varepsilon_k,
\qquad \text{where } \varepsilon_k \in \{-1, +1\},\ \mathbb{P}(\varepsilon_k = 1) = \mathbb{P}(\varepsilon_k = -1) = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

The fall time is

$$
\tau = \inf\{n \ge 1:\ X_n = 0\}.
$$

**Question 1: Computing $\mathbb{P}(\tau < \infty)$**

Let

$$
p = \mathbb{P}(\tau < \infty \mid X_0 = 1).
$$

At the first step:

- with probability $1/2$, he goes to $0$ and falls immediately;
- with probability $1/2$, he goes to $2$ and must fall from position $2$.

So:

$$
p = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\,\mathbb{P}(\tau < \infty \mid X_0 = 2).
$$

**Link between probabilities from 1 and from 2:**

To fall from position $2$, one must first reach $1$, then reach $0$ from $1$. By translation invariance, the probability of reaching $1$ from $2$ equals the probability of reaching $0$ from $1$, which is $p$. By the strong Markov property, once at $1$, the probability of falling is again $p$, independently of the past. Thus:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\tau < \infty \mid X_0 = 2) = p \cdot p = p^2.
$$

We obtain the equation:

$$
p = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} p^2.
$$

Hence:

$$
2p = 1 + p^2
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
p^2 - 2p + 1 = 0
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
(p-1)^2 = 0.
$$

Therefore:

$$
\boxed{p = 1.}
$$

The man falls with certainty.

**Question 2: Expected time before falling**

Since $p = 1$, "given that he falls" changes nothing:

$$
\mathbb{E}[\tau \mid \tau < \infty] = \mathbb{E}[\tau].
$$

Let

$$
m = \mathbb{E}[\tau \mid X_0 = 1].
$$

At the first step:

- with probability $1/2$, he falls in 1 step;
- with probability $1/2$, he goes to $2$, and must then fall from position $2$.

By translation and the strong Markov property, the expected time to fall from position $2$ is:

$$
\mathbb{E}[\tau \mid X_0 = 2] = \underbrace{\mathbb{E}[\text{time from } 2 \text{ to } 1]}_{= m} + \underbrace{\mathbb{E}[\text{time from } 1 \text{ to } 0]}_{= m} = 2m.
$$

Counting the first step:

$$
m = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot (1 + 2m).
$$

Expanding:

$$
m = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + m
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
m = 1 + m
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
0 = 1,
$$

a contradiction.

Therefore the assumption $m < \infty$ is false, and:

$$
\boxed{\mathbb{E}[\tau] = +\infty.}
$$

**Conclusion**

$$
\boxed{\mathbb{P}(\text{fall}) = 1 \quad\text{and}\quad \mathbb{E}[\tau] = +\infty.}
$$

This is a classic example of a stopping time $\tau$ that is almost surely finite, but has infinite expectation.
