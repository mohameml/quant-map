## Problem

A building has $10$ floors above the basement (floors $1, 2, \dots, 10$). In the basement, $12$ people enter an elevator. Each person independently and uniformly at random chooses a floor from $\{1, \dots, 10\}$ to exit.

How many floors will the elevator stop at on average (i.e., at how many different floors will at least one person exit)?

## Hints

<Hint n={1}>
    Define an indicator variable $I_i$ for each floor $i$ that equals 1 if the
    elevator stops there. Use linearity of expectation and the complement to
    compute $\mathbb{E}[I_i]$.
</Hint>

## Solution

For each floor $i \in \{1, \dots, 10\}$, define the indicator variable

$$
I_i = \mathbf{1}_{\{\text{the elevator stops at floor } i\}}.
$$

Then the total number of stops is

$$
S = \sum_{i=1}^{10} I_i,
\qquad\text{so}\qquad
\mathbb{E}[S] = \sum_{i=1}^{10} \mathbb{E}[I_i]
$$

(by linearity of expectation).

Now $\mathbb{E}[I_i] = \mathbb{P}(I_i = 1)$ is the probability that at least one of the 12 people chooses floor $i$. By complement:

$$
\mathbb{P}(I_i = 1) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(\text{no one chooses } i)
= 1 - \left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^{12},
$$

since each person avoids floor $i$ with probability $9/10$, and the choices are independent.

Thus, for every $i$,

$$
\mathbb{E}[I_i] = 1 - \left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^{12}.
$$

Finally,

$$
\boxed{
\mathbb{E}[S]
=
10\left(1 - \left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^{12}\right).
}
$$
