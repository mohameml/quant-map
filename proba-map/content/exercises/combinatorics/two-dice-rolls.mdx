## Exercise

A fair six-sided die is rolled twice successively.

Calculate the probability that the value obtained on the first roll is strictly less than the value obtained on the second roll.

## Hint

Count how many ordered pairs $(x_1, x_2)$ satisfy $x_1 < x_2$ by considering, for each possible value of the second roll, how many values the first roll can take.

## Solution

Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ denote the results of the two rolls.

The sample space is:

$$
\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}^2
$$

which has cardinality $36$, with all pairs being equally likely.

We want to find:

$$
P(X_1 < X_2) = \frac{\text{number of pairs } (x_1, x_2) \text{ such that } x_1 < x_2}{36}
$$

For each value of $x_2$, the number of values of $x_1$ that are smaller is $x_2 - 1$.

Thus:

$$
\#\{x_1 < x_2\} = \sum_{x_2=1}^6 (x_2 - 1) = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
$$

Therefore:

$$
P(X_1 < X_2) = \frac{15}{36} = \frac{5}{12}
$$
