## Problem

A fair six-sided die is rolled repeatedly. We are interested in the probability that all odd values $\{1, 3, 5\}$ appear at least once _before_ any even value $\{2, 4, 6\}$ appears.

## Hints

<Hint n={1}>
    Think about the order in which the six distinct faces appear for the first
    time. By symmetry of a fair die, what is the distribution of this order?
</Hint>

## Solution

Consider the order in which the six distinct faces $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ appear for the first time. Since the die is fair, by symmetry the order of first appearances is uniformly distributed over all permutations of $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$. Hence there are $6!$ equally likely orders.

The event "all odd values appear before any even value" occurs if and only if the first three positions in this order are occupied by the three odd numbers $\{1, 3, 5\}$ (in any order), and the last three positions are occupied by the three even numbers $\{2, 4, 6\}$ (in any order).

Therefore the number of favorable permutations is

$$
3! \times 3!.
$$

Thus,

$$
\mathbb{P}(\text{all odds appear before any even})
= \frac{3!\,3!}{6!}
= \frac{36}{720}
= \boxed{\frac{1}{20}}.
$$
