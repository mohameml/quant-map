## Problem

You roll a fair six-sided die and sum the outcomes until you reach a multiple of 6. What is the expected number of times you roll the die?

## Hints

<Hint n={1}>
    Use first-step analysis: condition on the value of the first roll. With
    probability $1/6$ you roll a 6 and stop immediately. Otherwise, you must
    continue.
</Hint>

<Hint n={2}>
    After a non-six roll, the problem resets: regardless of the current sum
    modulo 6, you still need the running sum to hit the next multiple of 6. Set
    up an equation $x = \frac{1}
    {6} \cdot 1 + \frac{5}
    {6} \cdot (1 + x)$ and solve.
</Hint>

## Solution

**Idea: First Step Analysis**

The key idea is to analyze the process according to the first roll. This method is known as first step analysis and relies on the law of total expectation.

**Reminder: Law of Total Expectation**

Let $T$ be a random variable and $A$ an event with $\mathbb{P}(A) > 0$ and $\mathbb{P}(A^c) > 0$. Then:

$$
\mathbb{E}[T]
=
\mathbb{E}(T \mid X_1 \in A)\,\mathbb{P}(X_1 \in A)
+
\mathbb{E}(T \mid X_1 \notin A)\,\mathbb{P}(X_1 \notin A)
$$

**Application to the problem**

Let

$$
x = \mathbb{E}[T]
$$

denote the expected number of rolls needed to reach a multiple of $6$, starting from a sum equal to $0$.

We condition on the value of the first roll $X_1$.

**Case 1: $X_1 = 6$.**
This happens with probability $\mathbb{P}(X_1 = 6) = \frac{1}{6}$. The sum immediately becomes $6$, which is a multiple of $6$, so the process stops after exactly one roll:

$$
\mathbb{E}(T \mid X_1 = 6) = 1.
$$

**Case 2: $X_1 \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$.**
This happens with probability $\frac{5}{6}$. After the first roll, the sum is not a multiple of $6$. One roll has been used, and from that point onward the problem is identical to the original one. Hence:

$$
\mathbb{E}(T \mid X_1 \in \{1, \dots, 5\}) = 1 + x.
$$

**Equation for $x$**

Applying the law of total expectation:

$$
x
=
\frac{1}{6} \cdot 1
+
\frac{5}{6} \cdot (1 + x).
$$

Solving:

$$
x = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{5}{6} + \frac{5}{6}x
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
x - \frac{5}{6}x = 1
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\frac{1}{6}x = 1.
$$

Thus:

$$
\boxed{\mathbb{E}[T] = 6}.
$$
