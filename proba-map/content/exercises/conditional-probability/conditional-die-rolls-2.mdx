## Problem

Dan rolls a fair six-sided die until the first $6$ appears.
Given that he observed at least one $5$ before the first $6$,
determine the expected total number of rolls.

## Hints

<Hint n={1}>
    Consider the first time a $5$ or a $6$ appears. What distribution does this
    waiting time follow, and what happens under the given condition?
</Hint>

<Hint n={2}>
    After the first $5$ appears, the process restarts independently. The
    remaining number of rolls until a $6$ follows a well-known distribution. Use
    linearity of expectation to combine the two phases.
</Hint>

## Solution

We model the experiment as follows.

Let $(X_n)_{n\geq 1}$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables,
where $X_n$ represents the result of the $n$-th roll, with

$$
\mathbb{P}(X_n = k) = \frac{1}{6}, \quad k=1,\dots,6.
$$

Define the random variable

$$
N = \inf\{n \geq 1 \mid X_n = 6\},
$$

which represents the total number of rolls needed to obtain the first $6$.

We condition on the event

$$
A = \{\text{at least one } 5 \text{ appears before the first } 6\}.
$$

**Step 1: Time of the first $5$ or $6$.**

Let

$$
T = \inf\{n \geq 1 \mid X_n \in \{5,6\}\}.
$$

At each roll,

$$
\mathbb{P}(X_n \in \{5,6\}) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}.
$$

Thus, $T$ follows a geometric distribution with parameter $\frac{1}{3}$, and

$$
\mathbb{E}[T] = \frac{1}{1/3} = 3.
$$

Under event $A$, the first element of $\{5,6\}$ observed is necessarily a $5$.

**Step 2: Waiting time for the first $6$ after a $5$.**

After the first $5$ appears, the process restarts independently.
Let $M$ be the number of rolls needed to obtain a $6$ from that point on.
Then $M$ follows a geometric distribution with parameter $\frac{1}{6}$, and

$$
\mathbb{E}[M] = \frac{1}{1/6} = 6.
$$

**Step 3: Computation of the conditional expectation.**

Under event $A$, the total number of rolls can be written as

$$
N = T + M.
$$

By linearity of expectation,

$$
\mathbb{E}[N \mid A] = \mathbb{E}[T] + \mathbb{E}[M] = 3 + 6 = 9.
$$

$$
\boxed{\mathbb{E}[N \mid \text{at least one } 5 \text{ before the first } 6] = 9}
$$
