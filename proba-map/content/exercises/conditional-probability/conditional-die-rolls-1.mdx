## Problem

Dan rolls a die until he gets a 6. Given that he did not see a 5, what is the expected number of times Dan rolled his die?

## Hints

<Hint n={1}>
Define $T$ as the number of rolls needed to get the first 6, and $E$ as the event that no 5 appears before the first 6. Think about what values each roll can take when both $\{T = n\}$ and $E$ occur simultaneously.
</Hint>

<Hint n={2}>
Compute $\mathbb{P}(T = n \cap E)$ by noting that the first $n-1$ rolls must land in $\{1,2,3,4\}$ and the $n$-th roll must be 6. Then use Bayes' formula to find the conditional distribution $\mathbb{P}(T = n \mid E)$ and identify which well-known distribution it corresponds to.
</Hint>

## Solution

Let $T$ denote the number of rolls needed to obtain a 6 for the first time.

Consider the event

$$
E = \{\text{no face } 5 \text{ appears before the first } 6\}.
$$

We want to find:

$$
\mathbb{E}[T \mid E] \, ?
$$

For $n \ge 1$, the event $\{T = n\} \cap E$ occurs if and only if:

- the first $n-1$ rolls take values in $\{1,2,3,4\}$,
- the $n$-th roll equals $6$.

Thus,

$$
\mathbb{P}(T = n \cap E) = \left(\frac{4}{6}\right)^{n-1} \frac{1}{6}.
$$

We then compute the probability of $E$:

$$
\mathbb{P}(E) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mathbb{P}(T = n \cap E) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{4}{6}\right)^{n-1} \frac{1}{6} = \frac{\frac{1}{6}}{1 - \frac{4}{6}} = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

The conditional distribution of $T$ given $E$ is therefore:

$$
\mathbb{P}(T = n \mid E) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(T = n \cap E)}{\mathbb{P}(E)} = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n-1} \frac{1}{3}, \qquad n \ge 1.
$$

This is a geometric distribution with parameter $p = \frac{1}{3}$. Consequently,

$$
\boxed{\mathbb{E}[T \mid E] = \frac{1}{p} = 3.}
$$
